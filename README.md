## The challenge

- **October 16, 2026.** ComfyUI announced the [#OpenSourceHiggsfield challenge](https://comfy.org/open-source-higgsfield/): "Higgsfield promised to open-source their entire platform. They didn't." Comfy and its partners, including NVIDIA, RunPod and MiniMax, put up $25,000 in prizes for open-source builds on the Comfy Developer Platform. The suggested tracks were Cinematic Studio, Re-shoot a video and Openjutsu (swap a character in a video).
- **October 26.** The Comfy team released its own entry, [OPENjutsu](https://github.com/D3voz/openjutsu), an open-source Genjutsu-style character swap, and the clonable [comfy-openjutsu](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/comfy-openjutsu) app template.
- **October 28.** Builder Night in San Francisco.
- **October 29.** ComfyUI [said](https://x.com/ComfyUI/status/2115928993623109648) Higgsfield had sent it a cease and desist asking it to shut the challenge down.
- **October 30.** Submission deadline.

Entries were found through the #OpenSourceHiggsfield tag on X and through GitHub search. Empty repositories, clones of other entries and private placeholders are left out.
