# Open Source Higgsfield [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Open-source Higgsfield AI alternatives on GitHub, starting with every notable project built for ComfyUI's #OpenSourceHiggsfield challenge: Genjutsu-style character swap, one-tap effects, camera re-shoots and full studios that run open-weights models on your own GPU or on Comfy Cloud.

91 challenge projects and 6 older alternatives, with stars and licenses as of 2026-10-30. Browse the same list by category at [jutsustudio.com/open-source-higgsfield](https://jutsustudio.com/open-source-higgsfield/).

## The challenge

- **October 16, 2026.** ComfyUI announced the [#OpenSourceHiggsfield challenge](https://comfy.org/open-source-higgsfield/): "Higgsfield promised to open-source their entire platform. They didn't." Comfy and its partners, including NVIDIA, RunPod and MiniMax, put up $25,000 in prizes for open-source builds on the Comfy Developer Platform. The suggested tracks were Cinematic Studio, Re-shoot a video and Openjutsu (swap a character in a video).
- **October 26.** The Comfy team released its own entry, [OPENjutsu](https://github.com/D3voz/openjutsu), an open-source Genjutsu-style character swap, and the clonable [comfy-openjutsu](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/comfy-openjutsu) app template.
- **October 28.** Builder Night in San Francisco.
- **October 29.** ComfyUI [said](https://x.com/ComfyUI/status/2115928993623109648) Higgsfield had sent it a cease and desist asking it to shut the challenge down.
- **October 30.** Submission deadline.
